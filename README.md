### Prompt:
Our client, TravelBuzz, has noticed a drastic decline in travel from their elderly demographic. Travel agencies are as rare as phone booths, and those fan-dangled computer machines are too clicky and clacky to spend too much time on. Traditional travel-booking sites are too complicated to navigate. How can we make travel bookings more accessible to this demographic?
